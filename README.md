## Backend Setup

You need a backend server running to handle PDF extraction and storing of details. The app assumes you have the following endpoints:

- `POST /generateDetails`: To process the extracted text from a PDF and return details.
- `POST /postdetails`: To save the extracted details to a database.
- `GET /getdetails`: To fetch a list of previously submitted resumes.

Make sure to modify the URL in the `App.js` and `Display.js` files if your backend is hosted at a different location.

## Usage

### Upload a Resume:

1. Navigate to the **Upload Resume** tab.
2. Choose a PDF file containing the resume, and the system will extract details like name, email, phone, etc.
3. The extracted details will be sent to the server for further processing.

### View Uploaded Resumes:

1. Switch to the **Display Details** tab.
2. The system fetches all uploaded resumes and their details from the server.
3. You can download the details as either a PDF or CSV.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend (Expected setup):

- Node.js / Express (for API endpoints)
- A service for extracting text from PDFs (e.g., `pdf-parse`)
